## Core Daily

Daily core meetings are open to the broader developer community. They're informal and range in discussion, but the general focus is to triage new pull requests against [urbit](https://github.com/urbit/urbit) and [vere](https://github.com/urbit/vere), progressing them towards merge and eventual release.

Pull requests and releases are tracked in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EwCUY8OVAC-2ZJipOHq1yEGlnlStYeSKdm2MNCfnIdc/edit).

## Core Architecture Meetings

Core Architecture meetings are held biweekly by the Urbit core developers to discuss UIPs, other technical issues, and coordinate work. Meetings are attended by core developers from various organizations.
